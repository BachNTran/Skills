Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree **one question at a time**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. From the frontier, ask the one question that unblocks the most others, with your recommended answer. Then wait for the answer.

Format each question like so:

```
❓ **<question title>**: <question body, including the choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Word each question so "yes" accepts your recommended answer.

Each answer reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier before the next question. Keep a short list of what is settled; show it every few questions and whenever the user asks.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it; don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report; ask another frontier question now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
